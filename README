INSTALLING
  In most cases, you do not need to compile or build the documentation
  as described below. Instead, to use with MATLAB, simply cd to the
  toolbox directory and type vl_setup.

  Binaries are created in the bin/XXX directory, where XXX changes
  depending on the architecture. We support the following (the naming
  reflects MATLAB naming for MEX files):

  - mac     Mac OS X PPC
  - maci    Mac OS X Intel
  - glx     GNU Linux i386
  - g64     GNU Linux x64
  - win32   Windows
  - win64   Windows (64 bit)

  The executable binaries can be installed anywhere in the command
  line path (the directory contains also the static library).

  More details may be found in the provided HTML documentation
  (doc/index.html).

COMPILING
  The core library and command line utilities require a common C
  compiler supporting the (old) C-90 standard (GCC and Visual C will
  do) plus a few common extension (see APPENDIX). To compile the MEX
  files, MATLAB needs also to be installed.

  LINUX AND MAC OS X. Make sure to have a recent version of GCC (at
  least 4.0) and GNU make (at least 3.81) installed. Edit the
  Makefile to adjust the paths to MATLAB and the mex command, or to
  disable MATLAB support. Then issue

  > cd vlfeat
  > make
 
  Earlier versions of GCC and make can be used, but this requires
  hacking the Makefile.

  WINDOWS. We provide a Microsoft NMAKE Makefile (Makefile.mak) that
  has been tested under Visual C++ 2008 Express and Matlab R2008a (minor
  adjustments may be required for other versions). Open the Visual C terminal,
  cd into the VLFeat directory and issue.
  
  > nmake /f Makefile.mak

  If you do not have Visual C++ 2008, or you have an older version of Matlab
  and wish to compile the mex files _only_, then you may start from our binary
  distribution. Enter the toolbox directory:

  > cd toolbox

  And run our mex compilation script from the Matlab command line:

  > vl_compile

  This has been tested with Matlab R14 and lcc, but other configurations should
  only require minor tweaking.
  
CREATING THE DOCUMENTATION
  This task is handled by various Makefile that have been tested
  under Mac OS X and Linux only. Compiling the documentation
  requires the following additional tools
  
  - fig2dev (part of transfig)
  - a modern LaTeX with
    + pdflatex
    + dvips
    + htlatex (possibily part of TeX4ht)
    + dvipng  (possibily a separated package)
  - doxygen

  FIGURES. Figures are preprocessed by typing

  > make -C doc/figures

  However you need to run some MATLAB code to generate part
  of the figures to start with. To this end, load MATLAB and
  (provided that everything is compiled and installed correctly)
  type

  > vl_demo

  TUTORIAL. To compile the tutorial, issue

  > make doc-deep
  > make doc

  SOURCE CODE DOCUMENTATION. To compile the source code
  documentation type

  > make doc-api
  
See the file doc/index.html for an overview.


APPENDIX
  CODE COMPATIBILITY. In addition to the C-90 standard, the C compiler
  is supposed to support the following common features:

  - long int (64 bit integer) support
  - variadic macro support

CHANGES
  0.9.4      Added quick shift. Renamed dhog to dsift and improved
             implementation and documentation. Improved tutorials.
             Added 64 bit Windows binaries. Many other small changes.
  0.9.3      Namespace change (everything begins with a vl_ prefix
             now). Many other changes to provide compilation support
             on Windows with Matlab 7.
  beta-3     Completions to the ikmeans code.
  beta-2     Many completions.
  beta-1     Initial public release.
